# Multiple Factor Experiments

# We tested whether the purpose of a loan affects loan amount funded and found that it does. However, we also know that it's unlikely 
# that loans are funded based only on their intended purpose. It's more likely that the company is looking at a holistic picture of an # applicant before they decide to issue a loan.
